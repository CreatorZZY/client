The musicians are tuning up, and the servants are hurrying to clear away the remains of the feast...\n\nCapulet enters, greets the masked strangers, and invites them to dance. Romeo sees Juliet and says to himself that this is the first time he's seen true beauty. Tybalt recognizes Romeo and sends for his sword, but Capulet orders Tybalt to do nothing. Saying that he'll make Romeo pay, Tybalt leaves...\n\nRomeo holds Juliet's hand, and begs a kiss, which she gives him. They kiss again, and then both are called away. As everyone is leaving, they each learn the name of the other, and they each exclaim upon the fate that has made each fall in love with his/her

He is entranced by her beauty and listens as she tells the night that she loves Romeo and wishes that he had another name. Romeo surprises her by offering to take another name for her love. At first, Juliet worries for Romeo's safety and then she worries that he may be a deceiver, but he wins her over with passionate vows of love. They pledge their love to one another and then Juliet is called away by the Nurse...\n\nAnswering the call of the Nurse, Juliet goes into the house, then comes right back out and tells Romeo that the next day she will send a messenger to find out when and where she is to meet and marry him. Juliet is again called back into the house, and Romeo starts to leave, but Juliet again comes back out, to set a time that her messenger should go to Romeo. Romeo tells her that the messenger should come at nine in the morning.

Romeo offers to stay and die, but Juliet urges him to leave...\n\nThe Nurse hurries in with the news that Juliet's mother is coming. Romeo kisses Juliet and leaps out the window. Juliet asks if they will ever see each other again; Romeo is sure they will, but Juliet is full of foreboding...\n\nLady Capulet, assuming that Juliet is weeping for Tybalt, tells her that she's grieving too much, then decides that Juliet must be weeping because revenge has not been taken upon Romeo. Lady Capulet expresses her hatred of Romeo and Juliet appears to agree with her, though what she really means is that she loves Romeo. Lady Capulet then delivers news which she thinks ought to cheer up Juliet she is to be married to Paris. Juliet declares that she will not. Lady Capulet replies that Juliet's father is coming, so Juliet ought to tell him that she won't marry Paris, if she dares...\n\nLady Capulet tells Capulet that Juliet has refused to marry Paris. Enraged, Capulet threatens to throw her out of the house if she doesn't change her mind. Juliet pleads with her mother to intervene, but Lady Capulet refuses...\n\nJuliet asks the Nurse for advice, and she tells Juliet that she ought to marry Paris because Romeo can never come back and Paris is better looking, anyway. Juliet pretends to accept the Nurse's advice but decides that she will go to Friar Laurence for his advice. If he can't help her, she will kill herself.","children":[["b20b8d3fcbed97b3fe934c50336cf25917819956","node-342c9447e5a824c797e463d4a2e00f0a386c1bcb"],["f22bfe045e1776877140bee357e0f217c69b8ed6","node-98a400aba6a52b4914b54bb7f5fe19114ca0571d"],["0e15e2f5ca5373db45489aef87d8f8bda5db359c","node-5c1d30a8d53bf08d19a86ef2cf9adbfd2f1ac4ff"],["84125602182477025762a2da68a773a45591eb20","node-d9815a970aecc08b5855813d70ad9e0db6649a4d"],["cbe6e20ad42b7d70dcf9b2288907578e3c21a2aa","node-8c7fb35c6a8e6f54a1362325b448ed21c1178b84"],["07ce0d81a6b9da5148b2af9653f289bf689bd632","node-6ecb2f261b4f1b247cef59ae7ffd7ac3ac3b08f9"],["95aefaf24b26a74d85443b7fce9e94c792defd6c","node-7932a760653cda015f536f2426b7676b4f1accd5"],["f4ac7320292f763865c441a09d5548d35e3e053c","node-b350bfb6136922c0bbc0e850bd234f52c465c3af"],["eb9a5bc3afdbea78c0bc156ecda563489df3b87d","node-9ee73d1ce79ebb859701eb04cc4cc5de8b5b4496"],["b94cff1042046a8aa368cbadd75ef57590ed5a17","node-2288641d57eff75ce49a47f5897c8d81b1b048d9"],["d3e06f8b19af157a65ed387457aa68119bcacae7","node-41af6bfe9134ed5c95637eef72500063f95404f0"],["c5f7769cbc0026aad2ba6091e0e868e488a26278","node-23ca8c01ff58706efa7af24575fe0f75b1d44083"],["2eb28359500fcb22e22cb3a3abd9796ac4bc6449","node-392189f0d11ec1802efbf93fba0de05cefea3337"],["c15492576495bce235fe8ef53c8c331a1994ed71","node-ee4adbaca206f017b6945714b5b7f8a24fbee484"],["65327425480f4b82e014c1bdf8acb3af8d2bff60","node-00a24bd2f71c0ffc00759d9612dc0b75785c6a04"],["2b48277b800ba0fcdc3d1b41f08c3319c25fa660","node-f30a5dd46a4423636c50a7b425222d15abbbdfd7"],["3c9d3d66ba8a9febe149a64a554c5f5aac0b3674","node-43200287955b910aa1e17b95cd8dcf3ac9f6db51"],["9e3ac92e50c7f622f2adaafe654e226c2c78d558","node-4b5a8c800ac5436740c4f0cf5c9c759c5fa6e0d3"],["354013cbfd9f4d29fbe27af54ba7bb64133fe1c9","node-57752ce7c299948b93d9cff769c77d0272600e54"],["146457e49aa9dd97d014e966fdee39ee8aa131c3","node-756870b195fc0fe3cc35d67825ec3d622ce98074"],["374cc3b66c1cd9256e0f1debfe5319c29ca8b5c6","node-b46fbb49f1bc3deed9e7058d06db14836efa1be4"],["e5b3da943cddc1b54fef78e1decba86378184223","node-12b9764557e330707b784a4b5dce45e59b5bd0d1"],["4a9be3af51d46379187504df20a047706a0c2cbe","node-1296fe64347ff63093e69b816624e0270347b411"],["2046d545c84d32de5861c05f7c4fb37b6d27c8b2","node-18011ea6046b218e6f4309a42e096c6d01d6103d"],["65b910ebab3dcd5c153f5fd7e151ea88014101ba","node-41beee9e2e10798a11480f85ac0359cd4ef428ad"],["247103f03c7f13c10eac3f54c259b07495198fa5","node-3a657eb2b3a40617eda69208b6d2317cbaae5686"],["7a2f601976ee10cd1f13c737ff2f74f2b8fb0e40","node-4d1ffd14c4290630302e2d30c7a50f09034838ca"],["d966bc46e795510ecf4ee13c4dc61e6d64504826","node-8e7c251c6f0e6d8c24c1b85e75c55bc86026e39c"],["f217da94b2e6cf1960ee8d0c382e6f80da0ceb11","node-b7718113c6cfca442c90f1d96de458c63c436894"],["a3e658d05bc61f7f7599f7f43bd50690b0b735f6","node-306504a660ffac39d319214d3841406c1647a5ef"],["80b8cdf6e275b82274aea0ea8179454e8e27eb8d","node-8c6916890e815ae47a89cde5938b7831dd981e63"],["1873710be0a9fe66d11d8454e2eb1f8fb67305c4","node-1396e397a658a0c135c9cc3a7fa7ff71bbe1f01b"],["e6552fe4fde2b53c30df74690ea1e4ed74bcf3ff","node-cd97a4bb56f3781bfd378259abd83d25f1f0d2af"],["14d1c0ad041978572a6883627873a5fedba0b004","node-cde20d4f8ce0d3beff51b2f21f3ed2995360229f"],["335c11d7d0e24098f210bfa8d3f3e2d078c673ce","node-2be2d895e25e786338f17baeebd563cee202a755"],["7bf9916696b79f8418619546599b31bbbdaa0967","node-a3666ebeda789b7e99c0c5be2d6df13b19eb488b"],["8b5bb8a64f4a954707a46e58a0d22ed9ee517d14","node-864427ff56e7ea6279569fcbf8cd2ffc3de4fba5"],["b3d20304397fa8791254340d9e009a01f7245a01","node-359af8f6e455e161961519abb4fc8234fa4eacbe"],["2bdcc9ec6e5219c28e496a634980c71fe02e046b","node-6b16c3753f683092f604fb8b469cafe4d67f5f15"],["29bab7a3c65616fb60ed6f108f325ab4d5956743","node-6577d64d87e7d81a27bf096f128fce4e1aa7aa08"],["c0c69b6d77abfd2cec23d648fd0951f5286f2f30","node-726d5cfe09283c875a43c4c435bf39977f618557"],["513b23fbc54b20e7b07682f67bd3421c58db32da","node-e2e7d1cd673e4c0877c2665377677c6882dd0b47"],["30be746d0958437da96d397f320aa69ef611018a","node-0ba1c0fae46fa120ed575181d35d14dc90b52bd5"],["93b8c6e3f46a5ecf76866c97ede04e24c73c12e5","node-13a7cfbefb81984ab507d339d2ab50900ed3effd"],["824b6adddb34beec073e2962ddb86bc905541a03","node-486df2dc182c9b6b389296f7881224474112223a"],["d4f1aba2afed1bd73002e9eeaf78c7180c5f31cc","node-21609ff959ab28947bf7614899905b8d72fa2757"],["6ffe79366ea2e261239b802c981b375f31cea571","node-7138178ed43a2c8ef6cc77aaf11559a6b01c65cf"],["4c8c090a7df21d08f4815deed55c4597b6219f82","node-dd4ec76f385a731ad73b326ca82cff7a4f0fd284"],["180e386730144567c93fe5e9d62b0ba6772f906c","node-bdf067834fd56f805dbca88077a93dd9eeee4043"],["56c2e297bca5b7bd627dcaf3f13780c686c5f405","node-79ea616efadc6948651cfdf3cb9933b1af7ccb93"],["2dbe8b82c15ccd611982e721b01af608897876f3","node-a39a5b2cdcafaa037bac5dc8d19cc6179b2b2b90"],["527848e69d7349cad8adf2bc18b938d281654f55","node-49ca224d2b854fbea2e7e3dfc36219ff87aa3dce"],["9bc48d0c9f8bced2f50099d8efa8bcaad38bf490","node-d36e2c6b11fc3df7cb95024295f4f7346e87607b"],["b7c38a2e66fb76492fbc45dcf836933d9ad27885","node
