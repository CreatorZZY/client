Cards can have **one or more children** (shown to the right &rarr;).\n\nThis is an example \"tree document\" that you can play with. Go ahead and **double-click to edit** any card, or **drag-and-drop to move** it around.",

You can keep your hands on **the home row**.\n2. You can create cards **directly from edit mode**, unlike with Ctrl+arrows\n\nIt may take some getting used to, but possibly less than you'd expect.",

You can then hit \"Cancel\" to exit history navigation, and `Ctrl+v` to paste that card and all its children into the current version (or even a different document).\n\nIn other words, **you can feel confident in making changes**, because you can always bring back old versions, or even just parts of them.",
